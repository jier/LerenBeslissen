This is a UVA course where students apply their newly gained knowledge of machine learning into real world problems. The aim of this specific project is to take a look of how well movies are ranked by IMDB and how accurate our own ranking system is. This analysis is only possible by the availability datasets source from the website https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset.
